# Some notes:

- I'm using sqlmodel for iteracting with sql database - You should install it first: https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/
- you can run this from the root directory with `python francisco_idea/main.py`
- I've added the `if __name__ == "__main__":`in the `main.py` file. This is good practice to avoid running comands when importing things from that file
- For now, it just populates the database with the data - we can add the functionality to read it to your prefered format after
